# UCI Object Orientation in Ruby

## Introduction

Welcome! This course is designed to provide you with the tools to build
object-oriented code in Ruby.

First, we will introduce the Learn platform, how lesson content is delivered and
go through some environment setup. Then, we will briefly review some fundamental
Ruby concepts - things like data types, methods, and iteration.

After this, we will dive into Object Orientation starting with the syntax and
structure of Ruby classes and going all the way to building complex multi-class
applications. When you are ready to get started, click the "I'm Done" button and
proceed to the next lesson.
